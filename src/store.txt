      <p>
        Kakum National Park, located in the coastal environs of the Central
        Region of Ghana, covers an area of 375 square kilometres (145 sq mi).
        Established in 1931 as a reserve, it was gazetted as a national park
        only in 1992 after an initial survey of avifauna was conducted. The area
        is covered with tropical forest.The uniqueness of this park lies in the
        fact that it was established at the initiative of the local people and
        not by the State Department of wildlife who are responsible for wildlife
        preservation in Ghana. It is one of only 3 locations in Africa with a
        canopy walkway, which is 350 metres (1,150 ft) long and connects seven
        tree tops which provides access to the forest.
